# Naser AlDuaij
# Linux 3.1.10 version for running on both the android emulator and Nexus 7 device
# Code base: tegra (android-tegra3-grouper-3.1-jb-fr2)
# Emulator drivers and configuration files patched from 2.6.29 (Goldfish) and Linux 3.2

Known issues:
Emulator's keyboard is sometimes unresponsive for a couple of seconds, clicking the screen
	seems to remedy the issue

Instructions:
Android SDK is required. Device needs to be unlocked with USB debugging enabled (not necessary for emulator)
For the device you need to package a new boot image along with the ramdisk ramdisk.img extracted from
	Nexus 7 factory image (https://developers.google.com/android/nexus/images)
	The ram disk is modified to enable debugging on all apps and adb root access

a) These values have to be exported.
export ARCH=arm
export SUBARCH=arm
export CROSS_COMPILE=arm-eabi
export PATH=$(pwd)/prebuilt/linux-x86/toolchain/arm-eabi-4.4.3/bin:$PATH  # cd to parent dir of prebuilt
OPTIONAL: In order to change the kernel name shown in the OS use export LOCALVERSION="-YOUR_STRING"

b) cd in to source tree directory

c) Build for emulator or device under same source tree (NOTE: zImage gets overwritten after compilation)
	i) Emulator -
	make goldfish_armv7_defconfig
	make
	emulator -avd YOUR_AVD -kernel arch/arm/boot/zImage -show-kernel

	ii) Device -
	make tegra3_android_defconfig
	make
	adb reboot bootloader
	fastboot boot arch/arm/boot/zImage ramdisk.img	# This does NOT flash your device, next time you
							# restart you will get the inboxed image. In order
							# to flash your device look in to fastboot flash
